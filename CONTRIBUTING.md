### Things to know when using cc-neovim
In the dashboard, there is a shortcut for projects. To use that shortcut, you must either have a repo called '~/projects' or you must go into the keymaps config and change the path to your chosed directory.

Also, most of the snippets i've made are pretty minor. For now, you can either add your own, or rely on the default snippet suggestions that come from the lsp.

### Project Principles
You will probably notice the lack of general support for other languages other than C/C++. That is by design.

I have no problem with anyone forking this repo and using it however they want. However, know that I will probably never pull in any contributions that expand the scope of the project. It's called **cc-neovim** for a reason.

The only thing that I plan to do to expand the project (once I get it cleaned up nice and tight) is really tightened the debugging features first, and then adding functionality for build tool assistance (cmake).

If you have any interest in contributing, please reach out to me first. Thanks!
